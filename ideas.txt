Players have health, and how low on health they are decides how much they get
knocked back by bullets (think Smash Bros.)

Players lose health by getting hit by bullets or by colliding with the other
player (to try to stop people ramming into each other)

There are health pickups (maybe?)

Health should be recorded similarly to smash bros: a percentage that keeps
increasing

This percentage value could be multiplied into the force calculations on the
player (for example).
